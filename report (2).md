## Objective

In this project I aim to employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis in conjunction with a machine learning model, utilizing both the textual content of the 'review text' and the numerical 'overall' rating columns, to classify reviews into distinct sentiment categories, namely positive, negative, or neutral. Also develop a collaborative filtering recommendation system using user-item interactions and latent factor modeling to generate personalized product ('asin') recommendations, leveraging historical review data and user preferences.

## Background
The Text Analysis of Amazon Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food Product Reviews will provide a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews and ratings for food products on the Amazon Fresh platform. By delving into this dataset, through natural language processing and machine learning techniques, seek to uncover trends and patterns that can inform businesses, consumers, and the broader food industry.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA report offers a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, addressing missing values and duplicate rows while presenting vital statistics. EDA serves as the cornerstone for subsequent analysis, data cleansing, and modeling. Within the context of preparing the dataset for deeper analysis, I have conducted essential exploratory data analysis (EDA). This process sheds light on the data types within the dataset, which are fundamental for data manipulation and analysis. 

During this analysis, I have identified missing values in the dataset, with 'reviewerName' having 1,493 missing entries and 'reviewText' having 22. To rectify this, we imputed these gaps with appropriate placeholders: 'Unknown' for 'reviewerName' and 'No review available' for 'reviewText.' This adjustment ensures the dataset is more comprehensive and suitable for analysis without sacrificing valuable data. Furthermore, we verified the dataset for duplicate rows. The absence of duplicate rows is a positive discovery as they can skew the analysis and lead to inaccurate results.

#### Key findings from the EDA report:

- The overall rating of the products in the dataset is high, with an average rating of 4.24 out of 5.
- The most recent review was posted in July 2014.
- The median review was posted in February 2013.
- The distribution of the overall ratings is skewed to the right, with more products having higher ratings.
  
#### Text Preprocessing:

- Imported the necessary standard libraries, including Gensim for topic modeling, NLTK for text processing, and Matplotlib for visualization.
- Normalized the text by converting the 'reviewText' column to lowercase, to ensure that the text is consistent and not case-sensitive.
- Initialized a set of English stopwords using NLTK. These stopwords are common words like 'the,' 'and,' 'is,' etc., which are often removed from text data as they do not carry significant meaning.
- Defined a function preprocess_text to tokenize the text and remove stopwords. Which tokenizes the text, converts it to lowercase, and filters out non-alphabetic words and stopwords. The processed_documents list is created by applying the preprocess_text function to each document in the 'reviewText' column of the DataFrame.
- Defined another function, returning_tokinize_list, to tokenize all the words in the 'reviewText' column and combine them into a single list named tokenize_list_words for further analysis.

#### Topic modeling 

**1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**

- Created a dictionary using the Gensim library. It associates words with unique integer IDs.
- Generated a corpus by converting each document into a bag of words. Each document is represented as a list of (word ID, word frequency) pairs based on the dictionary created earlier. This prepares the data for the LDA model.
- Performed LDA topic modeling using Gensim's LdaModel. It specifies the number of topics (in this case, 5) and uses the corpus and dictionary created earlier as input data. 
- We were further able to print the top words associated with each topic. For example, topic 0 is associated with words like 'coffee,' 'flavor,' 'cup,' and 'taste.'

To assess the quality of the topics produced by the LDA model, a coherence score is calculated using the 'CoherenceModel'.   The coherence score quantifies the level of clarity and interpretability of the issues. Analyzing the recognized topics and their top words can offer significant insights into the content of the dataset, making it a useful technique for organizing and understanding text data.

The distribution of the number of reviews shows that the majority of reviewers (80%) leave one or two reviews, while a small percentage of reviewers (20%) leave more than two reviews. This suggests that there is a small group of frequent reviewers.

Overall, the analysis of the plot suggests that there are two patterns in reviewer behavior:

- There is a small group of frequent reviewers.
- Frequent reviewers are more likely to leave extreme ratings than infrequent reviewers.
  
Additionally, the plot shows that the majority of reviews are positive (4-5 stars), with a small percentage of negative reviews (1-2 stars). This suggests that customers are generally satisfied with Amazon Grocery.

Some specific insights that can be drawn from the plot include:

- The top 3 most reviewed grocery items are fresh produce, meat and seafood, and dairy products. This suggests that these items are important to customers and that they are looking for quality products in these categories.

- The top 3 most positively reviewed grocery items are fresh produce, dairy products, and beverages. This suggests that customers are particularly satisfied with the quality and selection of these items.

- The top 3 most negatively reviewed grocery items are processed foods, snacks, and candy. This suggests that customers may be looking for healthier options in these categories or that they are not satisfied with the quality of the products currently available.
